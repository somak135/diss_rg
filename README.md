### Dissertation project on depreferential random graph through preferential attachment

This is the github project for my final year dissertation on "depreferential random graph through preferential attachment", supervised by Prof. Antar Bandyopadhyay. The folders contain necessary ingredients, with the folder names being self explanatory. In particular, the ```mid-report``` folder contains

- The mid-term report
- The simulation codes in four .ipynb files
- The supplimentary PDF containing the extra simulation plots which are skipped in the primary report
